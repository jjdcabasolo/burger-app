# Burger app

This app was based on Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's (https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/) React basic course entitled "**React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)**" (https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) at udemy.



### Web framework

This is my very first **React** app (v.16.5.0) that implements:

- stateful, stateless, and pure components
- HOC's
- lifecycle methods



### State management

**Redux** (v.4.0.0) was used to handle state management. It uses `connect()` HOC for declaring states and actions to a component.



### Styling

**CSS Stylesheet** was used, since this was a beginner app. Each file/component has its own CSS file and the naming convention is on this format

`.<componentName>-<purpose>`

It is on `kebab-case`, starting with the component name followed by a short description on where/how it was used.



### UI Framework

**Semantic UI's React integration** was used (v.0.82.5) which was heavily customized for aesthetic purposes.



### Other dependencies

List of other packages/modules used for this application:

- **react-fullpage**: for the PowerPoint-like presentation for home/landing page
- **react-reveal**: for the animations throughout the app
- **gh-pages**: for app deployment on GitHub pages
